    "# Titanic Survival Prediction: 02 - Modeling\n",
    "*Date: 14.09.2025*\n",
    "*Author: Jonas Lilletvedt*\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook marks the second part of the Titanic Survival Prediction project: model training and evaluation. We will build directly on the pre-processing pipeline constructed in `01_data_cleaning_and_feature_engineering.ipynb`. The primary objective is to systematically train, evaluate, and tune a selection of models to find the optimal balance between predictive performance and interpretability. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preparation and Pipeline Reconstruction:** We will begin by loading datasets and rebuilding the pre-processing pipeline from the previous notebook to ensure a consistent and reproducible environment.\n",
    "2. **Baseline Model Evaluation:** A selection of diverse classification models (e.g., K-NN, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) will be used as baseline and later help us identify strategies for optimization. \n",
    "3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The best-performing model from the baseline evaluation will undergo systematic hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV. The goal is to maximize its predictive performance based on our primary evaluation metric, the F1-Score. The reasoning for selecting this metric is detailed in the section below.\n",
    "4. **Final Analysis and Iteration:** Finally, we will analyze the results and train the optimized model on the full dataset to generate final predictions for a Kaggle submission. We will conclude by exploring potential avenues for future improvements, such as alternative modeling techniques or further feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our end goal is twofold: to develop a model that is competitive on the Kaggle leaderboard, while remaining understandable enough to provide insights into the factors that influence survival. The process will be iterative, allowing us to refine our approach based on model performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the Leaderboard: A Focus on Interpretability\n",
    "Unlike many competition-driven projects that prioritize raw predictive power above all else, this analysis places a strong emphasis on interpretability. While achieving a high Kaggle score is a key objective, it is equally important to build a model whose decision-making process can be understood. By favoring models and features that provide clear insights—for instance, by showing why certain passengers were more likely to survive—we aim to produce not just a \"black box\" predictor, but a meaningful analysis of a historical event. This balanced approach ensures that our final result is both powerful and insightful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Defining Success: Beyond Simple Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "While accuracy is a straightforward metric, it can be misleading. A simple \"naive\" model that predicts survival for all females and death for all males achieves an accuracy of approximately 78.7% on the training data. Any model we build must therefore significantly outperform this baseline to be considered valuable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To truly understand our model's performance, we must select the right evaluation metrics for the task. The most useful evaluation metric depends on the specific problem you are trying to solve. For example, in medical screening for a virus, achieving a high Recall is more important than high Precision. We would want to identify as many infected people as possible, even if it means accepting some false positives. In other situations, however, overall Accuracy might be the primary goal.\n",
    "Applying this to the Titanic problem, our context is one of historical analysis and balanced prediction. There is no real-world cost that makes predicting a death incorrectly worse than predicting a survival incorrectly. Our goal is not just to be right, but to build a model that is equally effective at identifying both those who survived and those who did not.\n",
    "For this reason, we need metrics that reward this balance and are not skewed by the class distribution. While we will still consider overall Accuracy, our primary metric for model evaluation is:\n",
    "*   F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall. Provides an overall score between precision and recall. "

    "1. **XGBoost**: A more efficient and powerful implementation of Gradient Boosting, widely known as a go-to algorithm for machine learning competitions. It offers key advantages over the standard implementation, including advanced regularization to improve accuracy by preventing overfitting, and superior support for parallel processing to significantly reduce training times.\n",

    "2. **Voting Classifier**: A Voting Classifier is an ensemble method that combines the predictions from multiple models to generate a more robust final prediction.In our case, we can take our two best-tuned models (Support Vector Machine and Gradient Boosting) and average their prediction probabilities. Different models learn in different ways and therefore make different types of errors. By combining them, we can often cancel out these individual mistakes, leading to a more accurate and reliable outcome. The key to a successful ensemble is model diversity, for this reason, we will combine our SVM and Gradient Boosting models, as they have fundamentally different structures. Combining two similar models, like Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, would be less effective as they are likely to make the same kinds of errors."
