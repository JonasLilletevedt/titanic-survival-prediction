    "# Titanic Survival Prediction: 01 - Initial data exploration\n",

    "## 1. Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will perform an initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the training data. We want to:\n",
    "*   Understand the data structure, variables, and statistical properties of the data set.\n",
    "*   Identify and quantify data quality problems, this includes NANs, outliers and nonrational values.\n",
    "*   Construct a clear path for the data cleaning and feature engingeering for the following notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data source\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this notebook is the 'train.csc' file froim the [Kaggle \"Titanic - Machine Learning from the Disaster\" competiotion] (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Plan for the inital expection\n",
    "\n",
    "We will proceed in the following steps:\n",
    "1.  **Setup** Import necesarry libraries and load the raw data.\n",
    "2.  **Initial inspection** A high level overview using buil in functions from pandas, like `.info()`, `.head()` and `.describe()`.\n",
    "3.  **Data visualization (EDA):**\n",
    "    *   Analyze the target variable (`Survived`).\n",
    "    *   Analyze the individual features (Univariate analysis).\n",
    "    *   Analyze the relationship between features and the target (Bivaritate analysis).\n",
    "4. **Summary and Next steps:** Document key findins and define a clear plan for further notebooks.\n"

    "    *   **Hypothesis**: Despite its high cardinality, the `Name` feature is rich with implicit information. Many of the names are prefixed with a title like *Mrs*, *Mr* or *Dr*. These titles indicates sex, age if no title, marriage and economic and socioeconomic status. Last but not least the surname could be used to indicate family members. There is a large possibility that family members stick together during crisis.\n",
    "        *   **Titles**: Prefixed like *Mr.*, *Miss.*, *Mrs.* and *Master.* are strong proxies for sex, age and marital status. Other titles like *Dr.* or *Rev* can indicate socioeconomic status and profession.\n",
    "        *   **Surname**: The surname can be used to identify potential family members groups that might not be fully captured by `SibSp` and `Parch` features. It's hypothesized that family members may have had survival outcomes due to staying together. \n",
    "    *   **Strategy**: Engineer two new features by decomposing the `Name` column.\n",
    "        *   `title`: A categorical feature extracted from the name prefix. To prevent possible over-fitting and noise rare titles will be consolidated into a single 'Rare' category.\n",
    "        *   `family_survival_rate`: A numerical feature representing the survival rate of a passengers's family unit. \n",
    "            *   **Family Identification**: A robust Family_ID will be created by combining the passenger's `surname` and `ticket_prefix`. This approach helps prevent misidentifying different families with the same surname, but traveling with a different ticket type. \n",
    "            *   **Leakage Proof calculation**: To avoid data leakage, the survival rate will be calculated for each passenger's family excluding the passenger themselves.\n",

    "    *   **Hypothesis**: A passenger's physical cabin location on  the ship, encoded in `Cabin` string, is a strong predictor for survival.\n",
    "    *   **Strategy**: Deconstruct the `Cabin` string into vertical and horizontal location:\n",
    "        *   `cabin_prefix`: A categorical feature for any text based-prefix (the deck, vertical location).\n",
